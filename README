This is a simple python version of wordle. The application will

1. Get a random 5 letter word from an API
2. Play a round of Wordle for the User
3. Ask the User if they would like to play again

While the application does check to make sure that a guess is 5 letters, it does not check to see if that word is a valid word. Guesses like aaaaa will count against the users guess total
